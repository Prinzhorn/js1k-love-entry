/*
 * READ BEFORE: Please don't try to understand everything. That's the code I actually handcrafted, but even after a one day break it was hard to start again. You have been warned.
 *
 * Props for the idea on how to draw a heart go to: http://www.mathematische-basteleien.de/heart.htm
 * I also had a working version using single pixels and a function (see below), but drawing arcs and lines is WAY faster.
 * The same goes for drawing text, which is WAY to slow.
 *
 * Original heart function
 * var x = x/s/.02 - (h.x*50/s);
 * var y = -y/s/.02 + (h.y*50.5/s);
 * (x*x + 2 * (b = (y - .9 * Math.sqrt( x<0?-x:x ))) * b) && (...draw red pixel...)
 *
 *
 * Each heart is stored inside an array: [size, x, y, color, time added]
